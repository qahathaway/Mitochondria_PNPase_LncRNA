# Primary Sequence and Secondary Structure of Nuclear-Encoded Long Non-Coding RNAs Predict Binding to Mitochondrial PNPase

# Background
We propose a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-mitochondrial interaction pathway where PNPase, through its KH and S1 domains, interacts with identifiable primary sequences and secondary structures on nuclear-encoded lncRNAs to facilitate mitochondrial attachment.

# Methods
RNA from FVB/NJ mouse and human patient cardiac tissues were isolated into subcellular compartments (cytoplasmic and mitochondrial) and crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) with mitochondrial PNPase were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq, respectively. LncRNA sequence and structure were evaluated through supervised machine learning algorithms (CART and SVM). In HL-1 cells, qPCR of PNPase CLIP knockout mutants (KH and S1) were performed.
