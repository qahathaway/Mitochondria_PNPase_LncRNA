# Primary Sequence and Secondary Structure of Nuclear-Encoded Long Non-Coding RNAs Predict Binding to Mitochondrial PNPase

# Background
Extranuclear localization of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is poorly understood. We propose a lncRNA-mitochondrial interaction pathway where PNPase, through its K Homology (KH) and S1 domains, interacts with identifiable primary sequences and secondary structures on nuclear-encoded lncRNAs to facilitate mitochondrial attachment.

# Methods
FVB/NJ mouse and human patient cardiac tissues were collected. RNA from isolated subcellular compartments (cytoplasmic and mitochondrial) and crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) with Polynucleotide Phosphorylase (PNPase) within the mitochondrion were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq, respectively. LncRNA sequence and structure were evaluated through supervised (Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Support Vector Machines, (SVM)) machine learning algorithms. In HL-1 cells, qPCR of PNPase CLIP knockout mutants (KH and S1) were performed.
